        <p>I am a senior dual degree candidate in Computer Science and Statistics (B.Sc.) and Cognitive Systems (B.A.) at the University of British Columbia (UBC). My research interests lie in HCI, information visualization, perceptual processing, and human-centered technology. </p>
       	<p>I'm curious about the arbritrariness and complexity of the mind and its machinery. My fascination with the mind has led me to pursue a wide range
	of research projects at UBC.</p> 
	<p>Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the UBC Visual Cognition Lab, where I investigate the perceptual properties of scatterplots with Prof. Ronald A. Rensink</p>
        <p>Previously, I researched various incentives and methods ... with Prof. Karon E. MacLean and Dr. Hasti Seifi at the UBC Sensory Perception and Research Group.</p>
      	<p>Prior to that, I was developing usability tests for the ValueCharts project with Prof. Guiseppe Carenini and Emily Hindalong.</p>


	<p> I'm currently exploring full-time job opportunities in UX Research and Analytics starting in September 2020.</p>
